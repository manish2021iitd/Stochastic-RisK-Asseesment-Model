Fit Comparisons for Each Engineered Variable

1. Interarrival Time:

* Best fit visually aligns with Exponential (as expected for interarrival models).

* Lognormal and Weibull add heavier tails.

2. Severity (Profit Ratio):

* Clear heavy tail â€” Lognormal fits well.

* Pareto also approximates the tail, but with less accuracy in the central region.

3. Lead-Time Variance:

* Weibull and Lognormal both perform well.

* Exponential underestimates low-frequency, high-delay cases.
